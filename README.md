UPDATE 2/12:
World exploration.
Four areas to explore.
	- Weird. This is the main priority.
	
Elementary Goals (30 Minutes Exploration):
- Cloaked Figure.
	
- Colorblind Option
	- (CRTV Design)
- GameBoy Colors to RGB
- GreyScale to RGB, finding colors through the world.
		- Objects are not interactable until you find the right color.
- Objects are silhouetted until the proper color, object with no color cannot be     interacted.
- Doors with no color are locked.
- Hub World changes with each additional monster.
- Tapestry that changes with colors	
- Cycle of Play: Get Power up, Get Color, Return to Hub.
- Return to hub is more difficult as more color are discovered. 
			- Red, Castle, Dash
			- Green, Forest, Double Jump
			- Blue, Dungeon, Wall Cling 
			- RGBoss
		- Three Control Game, Move Left/Right and Jump
	-  (BOSS) Obstacle course out of the dungeon
		- Timed, maybe monster chasing you?
		- The world was made colorless to seal the monster away. (STORY)
- Game Play.
		- Tighter controls.
		- Fall Control.
		- Character size.
			- Double Jump (Double tap Jump) 
			- Dash (Double tap a Direction)
			- Wall Cling (When jump on a wall stick to it, hold a direction)
		- No Enemies, Player Vs. Environment
			- Monster Residue, Pieces of the final monsters scattered everywhere.
- Free Exploration
			- Hub World.
	- Visually Cute, nice.
		- Death implied through crossed over eyes.
